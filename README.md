Given some time, I can improve the code by doing following changes:
- Log4j can be used instead of Syso method to improve the performance
- ITestListners can be implemented to take the screenshot as and when a test fails and to keep the driver listen to the DOM
- Extent report can be added to get the test results in a well designed html page
- Driver can be instantiated once instead of repeatinf for each test case. As the test scenarios are written and as i am quitting the browser for each scenario, I am calling the driver object for each test case.
